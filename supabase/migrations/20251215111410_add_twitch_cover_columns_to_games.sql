  # Add Twitch Cover Metadata to Games Table
  
  1. Schema Changes
    - Add `twitch_cover_url` column to store high-resolution game covers from Twitch API
    - Add `twitch_game_id` column to store the Twitch game ID for future API calls
    - Add `cover_last_updated` timestamp for cache invalidation (refresh every 7 days)
  
  2. Purpose
    - Enable automatic game cover fetching from Twitch Helix API
    - Cache covers locally to avoid repeated API calls
    - Support the Game Hub carousel with high-quality game artwork
  
  3. Notes
    - twitch_cover_url provides 600x800 resolution covers by default
    - cover_last_updated is used to determine when to refresh the cache
